## Project Overview
This project focuses on sensor fusion and AI for autonomous vehicles. It includes datasets, model training, and testing for object detection using YOLOv8.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository: https://github.com/aretiii/iseauto
2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
To train the model: python train.py --data path_to_dataset --epochs 30

## Future Work
- Improve dataset with additional classes.
- Optimize YOLOv8 model for faster inference.
